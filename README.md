## What is this?

TorDrop is a CLI tool for securely and anonymously sharing files over the Tor network.  
It creates a unique `.onion` link to share your file, protecting both your identity and the recipient's.

- ‚è∞ **Temporary Links**: Set TTL for link expiration  
- üì• **One-Time Downloads**: Link expires after first download  
- üì± **QR Code Support**: Easy mobile sharing

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+  
- Tor

4. Generates a shareable `.onion` link  
5. Recipients access the file via Tor Browser
